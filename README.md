Liturgical Calculations Libraries
=================================

This project includes open-source (MIT License) libraries in various
languages to aid in calculating the Western liturgical year.

The primary aim is to provide everything necessary to determine the
liturgical day in the _usus antiquior_ of the Roman Rite, including
both movable and static feast days.

Essentially, it is just a conversion of Pope Gregory XIII's 
_De anno et eius partibus_, found at the start of any Roman Missal
or Breviary, into programming libraries.
