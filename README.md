Liturgical Calculations Libraries
=================================

This project includes open-source (MIT License) libraries in various
languages to aid in calculating the Western liturgical year.

The primary aim is to provide everything necessary to determine the
liturgical day in the _usus antiquior_ of the Roman Rite, including
both movable and static feast days.

Essentially, it is just a conversion of Pope Gregory XIII's 
_De anno et eius partibus_, found at the start of any Roman Missal
or Breviary, into programming libraries.

Languages Covered:
-----------------

The project will begin with languages I am most comfortable with, and
which I tend to use the most, namely:

* C
* Python
* Cython

I am planning to add:

* Java
* Perl
* IA-64 Assembly (why not?)
* JavaScript

How to use the libraries:
-------------------------

Details on how to use the functions provided by the libraries can
be found in the READMEs of each language's directory.
